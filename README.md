Programming in Standard ML, by [Robert Harper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/).

To install the `sml` compiler, follow the instructions in 
https://www.smlnj.org/dist/working/110.99.2/index.html.

Hints:

```
$ wget http://smlnj.cs.uchicago.edu/dist/working/110.99.2/config.tgz
$ tar -xzf config.tgz
$ config/install.sh
```

Highly recommended that you use rlwrap to be able to navigate the REPL:

```
$ apt-get install rlwrap
```

Then, whenever using the REPL, prefix `sml` as such:

```
$ rlwrap sml
```

## Chapter 1

```
$ cd ch_1
$ sml ch_1.sml
```
